DART: Directed Assembly of Random Transition Metal Complexes
=========================================

Welcome to the DART documentation! This guide aims to provide all the information you need to get started with DART, whether you are a computational chemist, experimental researcher, or software developer.

Why Use DART?
=============

- **Rapid Assembly**: DART enables rapid, automated assembly of transition metal complexes, turning the usually cumbersome process into a matter of minutes.

- **Extensive Ligand Database**: With a database of over 41,018 ligands extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database, DART offers an expansive playground for materials discovery.

- **User-Focused Design**: DART is tailored for experimental chemists with little software experience, offering user-friendly instructions via simple text files.

- **Advanced Filtering**: Target your assembly towards specific types of complexes using DART's advanced ligand filtering options.

- **High Synthetic Viability**: DART generates complexes with high synthetic viability, thanks to its data-driven approach and extensive ligand database.

- **Open Source**: Developed in Python, DART is an open-source tool, making it accessible and customizable for your research needs.

    This is the documentation for the chemistry software **DART** (Directed Assembly of Random Transition metal complexes), developed by the CCEM group at Trinity College Dublin.

    DART allows to easily assemble novel metal complexes from a large database of ligands extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database, the MetaLig. In its current implementation, DART supports the assembly of a wide range of octahedral and square-planar geometries from 41,018 different ligands with assigned formal charges.


    Why DART?
    =========

    In contrast to other molecular assemblers and/or ligand databases, DART offers an all-in-one solution for the assembly of novel transition metal complexes. DART builds on top of the MetaLig, a database of 41,018 ligands extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and with automatically assigned formal charges. The enormous size of the MetaLig database allows for a combinatorial explosion of possible complexes in unimaginable numbers. However, usual applications in chemistry strongly limit the type of ligands interesting for a certain problem. Therefore, DART implements a wide variety of ligand filters and assembler options useful for targeting exactly defined chemical spaces. An example of this is shown in  :ref:`Pd_Ni_Cross_Coupling` in which we assemble a set of bromo(phenyl)palladium and bromo(phenyl)nickel complexes with varying P-N donors.
