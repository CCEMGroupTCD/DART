Troubleshooting DART
====================

.. _troubleshooting:

- DART cannot be found: Either DART is not installed or the correct conda env is not activated. Try running ``conda activate dart-env``.

- The input yaml file cannot be read: Yaml files are quite sensitive to indentation. Make sure that the indentation is correct. Ideally, copy paste the example yaml file and modify it.

- The input yaml file cannot be found: Make sure that the path to the yaml file is correct.
