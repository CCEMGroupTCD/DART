DART Assembler Output Documentation
===================================

.. _assembly_output:


What to Expect in the Output Folder
-----------------------------------

The output of the DART assembler will be saved in a specific folder. This folder is determined by the `output_path` you set in your assembly input file. Within this folder, each generated metal complex has a unique name such as `IKOTENIC`, which is automatically generated based on its coordinates.

The assembler module creates not only the xyz files for each complex but also various other files that could be of interest. Below, you'll find an overview of all files and folders generated by the DART assembler.

Folder Structure
----------------

Here's how the output folder will look::

    output_path/
    ├── info_table.csv                  (Summary Table)
    ├── concat_passed_complexes.xyz     (Successful Complexes)
    ├── ffmovie.xyz                     (Forcefield Trajectories)
    └── batches/                        (Batch Folders)
        ├── batch_1/
        │   ├── concat_passed_complexes.xyz
        │   ├── concat_failed_complexes.xyz
        │   ├── concat_passed_ffmovie.xyz
        │   ├── concat_failed_ffmovie.xyz
        │   └── complexes/              (Individual Complex Folders)
        │       ├── complex_1/
        │       │   ├── complex_1_structure.xyz
        │       │   ├── complex_1_ligandinfo.csv
        │       │   ├── complex_1_ffmovie.xyz
        │       │   └── complex_1_data.json
        │       ├── complex_2/
        │       └── ...
        └── batch_2/
            └── ...

Types of Output Files
---------------------

General Output Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These files provide a broad overview of the assembly process:

- **batches/**: This is a folder that contains all the batches of assembled complexes.
- **info_table.csv**: This is a summary table listing all generated complexes and their characteristics. It's a good starting point for understanding the results.
- **concat_passed_complexes.xyz**: This file contains the coordinates of all successfully generated complexes, bundled together. You can visualize these using software like ASE.
- **ffmovie.xyz**: This contains forcefield optimization trajectories for the successfully generated complexes.

Batch-Specific Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside the `batches` folder, you'll find separate folders for each batch. These folders may contain:

- **complexes/**: This is a folder that contains all the complexes for that batch.
- **concat_passed_complexes.xyz**: Coordinates of successful complexes for that specific batch.
- **concat_failed_complexes.xyz**: Coordinates of complexes that failed to assemble correctly.
- **concat_passed_ffmovie.xyz**: Forcefield optimization trajectories for successful complexes.
- **concat_failed_ffmovie.xyz**: Forcefield optimization trajectories for failed complexes.

If a file is missing, that means no complexes fall into that category for the batch (e.g., no failed complexes).

Complex-Specific Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within each batch, each complex has its own folder under `complexes`. These folders contain:

- **NAME_structure.xyz**: The 3D coordinates of the complex.
- **NAME_ligandinfo.csv**: Detailed information about the ligands in the complex.
- **NAME_ffmovie.xyz**: Forcefield optimization trajectory for the complex, if activated.
- **NAME_data.json**: This is a machine-readable data file, useful for further computational analysis.
