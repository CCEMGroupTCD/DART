TODO:

Todo before publication:
    - Cian read docs and especially give a more chemical explanation of why to rotate the phenyl ligand in the example

Todo for making DARTassembler available as python package:
    - make GitHub public
    - make Readthedocs public
    - make pip package (https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56)
        - if necessary, reduce MetaLig filesize when compressed to less than 60 MB in order to be installable via pip (atm it's compressed 65MB so that should be possible)
            - this depends on how good the pip compression is, maybe we don't have to change anything
            - if we do change the MetaLig, then use this opportunity to reindex ligand graphs if possible

assembly:
    - double check the ligand planarity filtering, it is very slow and I'm not sure if it's correct
