Understanding the DART Workflow
===============================

DART, short for Directed Assembly of Random Transition metal complexes, is an advanced computational platform designed for the rapid identification and exploration of novel transition metal complexes. It serves a broad spectrum of applications, including catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and energy-related materials.

**From Ligand Database to Complex Assembly**

At the heart of DART is the MetaLig database, a rich collection of 41,018 ligands derived from the Cambridge Structural Database with accurately determined formal charges. This database promotes the DART assembler module, enabling researchers to construct custom transition metal complexes that are tailored to their research goals.

**Targeting Chemical Space**

The ability to carefully select ligands for the assembler is crucial in generating complexes with enhanced stability and fitting to your own research needs. DART's ligand filter module assists scientists in refining their ligand choices, ensuring that the resulting complexes are relevant and potentially stable within their chosen fields of study.

**DART's Role in Material Discovery**

DART integrates into the materials discovery workflow as a tool that complements both theoretical and experimental methods. It facilitates the generation of hypotheses and guides experimental work, allowing for a more strategic exploration of chemical space.

By simulating the combinatorial assembly of compounds in silico, DART efficiently narrows down the search for promising candidates, streamlining the path from conceptualization to laboratory synthesis.

**Advancing Research with DART**

DART contributes to accelerating the pace of discovery in the field of computational chemistry, offering a window into a vast array of chemical compounds. Its application is a stepping stone towards significant developments in various areas of research, fostering a proactive approach to discovering new materials.
