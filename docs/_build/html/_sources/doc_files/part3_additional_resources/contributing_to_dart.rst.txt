Contributing to DART
====================

DART is an open-source project, and contributions from the computational chemistry community are essential to its growth and improvement. Your expertise and feedback are valuable assets that can help enhance DART's functionality and user experience. Here's how you can contribute:

**Providing Feedback**:
    If you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior while using DART, please report these issues on the GitHub repository's `Issues page <https://github.com/CCEMGroupTCD/DART/issues>`_. Your reports are crucial for identifying and fixing problems.

**Feature Requests**:
    Do you have ideas for new features or suggestions for existing ones? Maybe you're in need of additional ligand filters or have ideas for enhancing the assembly module. Submit your feature requests as GitHub issues, detailing your proposed changes or additions and how they would benefit users.

**Code Contributions**:
    If you've developed a new feature, fixed a bug, or improved documentation, you can submit your code through a pull request on Github.

**Improving Documentation**:
    High-quality documentation is key to a successful project. If you can clarify existing content or add examples, your contributions are welcome.

**Spread the Word**:
    Recommend DART to colleagues and friends in your professional network. The more users and contributors, the better DART can become.

Your contributions are what make open-source projects like DART thrive. We encourage you to join us in developing a tool that benefits the entire computational chemistry community.

Let's collaborate to make DART the best it can be!
