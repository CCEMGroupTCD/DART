Tips and Tricks around DART
============================

This section provides some tips and tricks in dealing with DART.

Visualizing concatenated xyz files with ase
----------------------------------------------

DART makes extensive use of concatenated xyz files, in which multiple molecules are stored in a single file. You can recognize a concatenated xyz file easily because it will always start with `concat_` and end on `.xyz`. These files makes it easy to browse through the molecules in order to doublecheck them. For example, you can browse through the ligands filtered out by a filter in the `ligandfilters` module to doublecheck that your filter is working correctly.

These concatenated xyz files can be visualized easily using the free software ``ase``. After downloading ``ase``, you can use the following command in your terminal to visualize the concatenated xyz file:

.. code-block:: bash

    ase gui <path_to_xyz_file>

**Display bonds:** Per default, ``ase`` does not display bonds. To display bonds, you can press `Ctrl` + `B` in the ase viewer. Since both bonds and background are colored white, you can also change the default settings of ase such that it uses a black background. To do that, create a file under the path `~/.ase/gui.py` and add the following line:

.. code-block:: python

    gui_default_settings['gui_background_color'] = '#000000' # black background

 For more details, please refer to the ``ase`` documentation.
