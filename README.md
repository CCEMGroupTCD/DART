# DART - Directed Assembly of Random Transition metal complexes
Welcome to the DART platform, a cutting-edge suite of tools for the generation and exploration of mono-metallic transition metal complexes! Developed by the CCEM group at Trinity College Dublin, DART is engineered to facilitate the design and analysis of molecular complexes for chemistry research.

DART integrates a collection of modules, each serving a unique function in the assembly process:

- **MetaLig** :
    Explore the comprehensive MetaLig database with 41,018 ligands extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database, complete with high-quality formal charge assignments.

- **Assembler** :
    Assemble novel transition metal complexes in a matter of seconds, guided by a simple configuration file for precise control over the resulting structures.

- **Ligand Filters** :
    Tailor assembled ligands to your research needs with a wide range of chemical and data-driven filters.

Using DART is simple. After download, just run the DART assembler and start generating complexes by executing the following command in your terminal:

    DARTassembler assembler --path assembly_input.yml
