# Simple Random Complex Generation

This example is a simple example of how to assemble random octahedral and square planar complexes with DART. This example is focussed on assembling a wide range of complexes with vastly different properties. For an example how to use DART for highly targeted and precise complex engineering, please see the example in `examples/Pd_Ni_Cross_Coupling`.
