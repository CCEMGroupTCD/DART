TODO:

paper:
    - add ligand databases 'Realigands' and 'tmqmLig'


Must:
- paths:
    - change default paths in Paths.py
- example:
    - fixed: Br, C6H5(q=-1, coord=C)
    - varying: P-N donors
- ligand db:
    - remove ligand with denticity = -1

Should:
- ligand filtering
    - add option to output 3D structures as xyz files
    - check if denticity == None gives same results as replacing with list(range(100))
    - add everything mentioned in the paper figure
- assembly input:
    - accept (A, B, C) as similarities
- fix bidentate rotator
    - Cian: integrate the option 'horseshoe' or 'slab' where the boxes are build.
- improve json complex output, especially the 'complex' data by getting rid of TMC class and making RCA_complex class instead
- in ligand information csv, output only first 5 CSD IDs.
    - add complex info such as stoichiometry to complex info csv
- ligand db:
    - remove non-buildable ligands
    - make unique IDs of ligands like Zotrux02 and in case this points to more than one ligand, add a letter to all of them like a, b, c etc.
    - add molecule planarity with 1.0 being perfectly planar and 0.0 being perfectly non-planar.
        - change the bidentate planarity checker to adhere to this convention, I think now it's the other way round.

Can:
- remove ligands with missing H from database

Future developments:
- bimetallic assembler:
    - only based on having 2 metals bound to each other, without ligands in between
    - only based on current mono-metallic ligands
    -
- database of non-innocent ligands
    - look of database:
        - coordinating atoms: elements, distances to metal, partial charges

- charge assignment:
    - automatically check for charges already assigned in the database
