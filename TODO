TODO:


Must:
- paths:
    - change default paths in Paths.py
- work on example
- work on documentation

Should:
- ligand filtering
    - add option to output 3D structures as xyz files
    - check if denticity == None gives same results as replacing with list(range(100))
    - refactor output ligand db path to not overwrite and to only take the folder name, not the whole path
    - add subgraph matching filter
output
- ligand db:
    - make unique IDs of ligands like Zotrux02 and in case this points to more than one ligand, add a letter to all of them like a, b, c etc.
    - add molecule planarity with 1.0 being perfectly planar and 0.0 being perfectly non-planar.
        - change the bidentate planarity checker to adhere to this convention, I think now it's the other way round.
    - check why some ligands have a 'metal_neighbor' attribute in the graph and some don't and remove or add it for all of them.
    - reindex ligand graphs
input:
    - write input class for gaussian input file, especially make sure that there is an 'others' specified in the basis sets
    - make sure in input that the indentation is fixed in the yaml file
    - Remove spin from metal input and add it to gaussian module?
- assembly:
    - fix that hydrides can't be assembled



Future developments:
- remove ligands with missing H from database
- bimetallic assembler:
    - only based on having 2 metals bound to each other, without ligands in between
    - only based on current mono-metallic ligands
    -
- database of non-innocent ligands
    - look of database:
        - coordinating atoms: elements, distances to metal, partial charges

- charge assignment:
    - automatically check for charges already assigned in the database
