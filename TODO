TODO:

Must:
- add non-random generation of complexes from ligands
- input
    - make dicts to yaml
- paths:
    - change default paths in Paths.py

Should:
- input:
    - talk about random/combinatorial input and input checks, especially with multiple ligand databases specified.
- fix bidentate rotator
    - add 'auto' setting based on function 'check_bidentate_rotator()' in Molecule.py
- add ligand overview csv output to ligand filters
- add ligand overview csv to assembly output, especially with CSD codes

Can:
- remove missing H ligands from dataset

Future developments:
- bimetallic assembler:
    - only based on having 2 metals bound to each other, without ligands in between
    - only based on current mono-metallic ligands
    -
- database of non-innocent ligands
    - look of database:
        - coordinating atoms: elements, distances to metal, partial charges
