TODO:

Must:
- add non-random generation of complexes fromm ligands
- fix issue with openbabel import dependent on version by adding missing registration in __init__ file in directory
- input
    - make dicts to yaml
- paths:
    - change default paths in Paths.py

Should:
- fix bidentate rotator
- add ligand overview csv output to ligand filters
- add ligand overview csv to assembly output, especially with CSD codes

Can:
- remove missing H ligands from dataset

Future developments:
- bimetallic assembler:
    - only based on having 2 metals bound to each other, without ligands in between
    - only based on current mono-metallic ligands
    -
- database of non-innocent ligands
    - look of database:
        - coordinating atoms: elements, distances to metal, partial charges
